## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Follow these guides in order for the complete setup:

### 1. **IDE Setup** → [`IDE/README.md`](./IDE/README.md)

- **VS Code**: Lightweight, extensible editor with data science extensions
- **PyCharm**: Full-featured Python IDE with advanced tools
- Platform-specific installation for Windows, macOS, Linux
- Essential extensions and configuration

### 2. **Virtual Environments** → [`VirtualEnv/README_venv.md`](./VirtualEnv/README_venv.md)

Choose your preferred workflow:

- **pyenv + pip + venv**: Traditional Python version and environment management
- **conda**: Data science-focused with built-in package management
- **uv**: Modern, fast dependency resolution with hybrid compatibility

### 3. **Version Control** → [`GitHub_repo/README_git.md`](./GitHub_repo/README_git.md)

- Git installation and configuration
- GitHub account setup and SSH authentication
- Repository creation and management
- VS Code integration and best practices
